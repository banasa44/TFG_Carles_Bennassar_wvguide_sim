This is my physics final project for the University of Barcelona.

It'll be developed with Python, using the meep library.

The project it's about to study the light acoplation between a optic fiber and a sillicon waveguide, trying to maximize the power of 
light transmited to the end of the waveguide.

I'm going to put everything I do in separate versions on Git Hub to start learning how GH works, so basically this are my 1st steps on GH.
